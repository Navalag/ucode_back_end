                  The application should be developed in PHP. Everything should work correctly, without errors.\n\n
                    Start the web server that should serve the app and keep an eye on the web console and the log file of the server.\n\n
                    As this application should provide only the functionality of API, you should check all of the entries changes in the database.\n\n
                    The real assessment is much more valuable than overestimated or underestimated marks.
                    First of all, you need to set up a project and install all dependencies (it should look something like this):\n
                    ```bash\n
                    >cd challenge_repo\n
                    >cp .env.example .env\n
                    >composer install\n
                    >php artisan migrate\n
                    >php artisan db:seed \n
                    >php artisan serve\n
                    ```\n
                    Do not forget to enter valid credentials into the `.env` file."
